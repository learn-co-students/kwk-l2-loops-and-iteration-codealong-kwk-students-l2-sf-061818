## Introduction

Sometimes, we need to do things repeatedly in programming. The same thing, over
and over, maybe hundreds or thousands of times.

Let's say we have a bunch of gifts to wrap. Like.. _a bunch_. A hundred exactly.

That's a lot of work, but we have to do it. As programmers, however, we can
break down the problem down, figure out the most efficient way to wrap
everything.  

These gifts all happen to be the same size and shape, so for every gift, we need
to measure out and cut a similarly sized piece of wrapping paper, fold it up
over the edges of the gift, tape it together, and add a nice little card.  Then
we set the wrapped gift aside and moved onto the next gift. Measure, cut, fold,
tape, add card, set aside. Measure, cut, fold, tape, add card, set aside. Measure, cut, fold, tape,
add card, set aside... phew!

¥In programming terms, we can think of each step as an action, a... _function_ that is called. It might look something like:

```js
// gift 1
measurePaperFor("teddy bear")
cutPaperFor("teddy bear")
foldPaperAround("teddy bear")
tapePaperFor("teddy bear")
attachCardOnto("teddy bear")
setAside("teddy bear")

// gift 2
measureTapeFor("drone")
cutTapeFor("drone")
foldPaperAround("drone")
tapePaperFor("drone")
attachCardOnto("drone")
setAside("drone")

// gift 3
measurePaperFor("doll")
cutTapeFor("doll")
foldPaperAround("doll")
tapePaperFor("doll")
attachCardOnto("doll")
setAside("doll")

...
```

...again and again.  Each step, one hundred times for one hundred gifts. Each
step (not shown here) is actually its own function, containing its own steps.
Let's focus on one step for now... the `setAside` function... and we'll say
that this function serves one purpose - it contains a message, an announcement
that a particular gift has been wrapped, like this:

```js
const gifts = ["teddy bear", 'drone', 'doll'];

function setAside(gift) {
  console.log(`Wrapped ${gift} and added a card!`);
}
```

In the above example, our gifts are just strings, collected in an **array**.
The `setAside` function takes in _one gift_, and interpolates it into a
message that is logged.

We could then call `setAside` on each gift individually:

```js
setAside(gifts[0]);
// => LOG: "Wrapped teddy bear and added a card!"
setAside(gifts[1]);
// => LOG: "Wrapped drone and added a card!"
setAside(gifts[2]);
// => LOG: "Wrapped doll and added a card!"
```

However, this isn't very efficient or extensible. It's a lot of repetitive code
to write out, and with one hundred gifts, we'd have to write 100 lines of code.

This is where loops come in handy! With a loop, we can just write the repeated
action **once** and perform the action on **every item in the collection**.

Loops are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. In
JavaScript, loops come in a few different flavors, but the main two are `for`
and `while` loops.

This is a code-along, so follow along with the instructions in each section.
There are tests to make sure you're coding your solutions correctly.

## The `for` loop

Of the loops in JavaScript, the `for` loop is the most common. The `for` loop is
made up of four statements in the following structure:

```js
for ([initialization]; [condition]; [iteration]) {
  [loop body]
}
```

- Initialization

  - Typically used to initialize a **counter** variable.

- Condition

  - An expression evaluated before each pass through the loop. If this expression evaluates to `true`, the statements in the loop body are executed. If the expression evaluates to `false`, the loop exits.

- Iteration

  - A statement executed at the end of each iteration. Typically, this will involve incrementing or decrementing a counter, bringing the loop ever closer to completion.

- Loop body

  - Code that runs on each pass through the loop.

***Usage***: Use a `for` loop when you know exactly how many times you want the loop to run
(for example, when you have an array of known size, 100 gifts).

### Examples

The code below will announce our next ten birthdays:

```js
for (let age = 30; age < 40; age++) {
  console.log(`I'm ${age} years old. Happy birthday to me!`);
}

// LOG: I'm 30 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 31 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 32 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 33 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 34 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 35 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 36 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 37 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 38 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 39 years old. Happy birthday to me!
```

```js
for ([initialization]; [condition]; [iteration]) {
  [loop body]
}
```

In the birthday example, `let age = 30` is the **initialization**, as we create a
variable, `age`, that we'll use in the next three phases of the loop. Notice
that we use `let` instead of `const` because we need to increment the value of
`age`.

The **condition** for the above loop is `age < 40`, or, in other words, "Run the
code in the loop body until `age` is NOT less than `40`." As long as the
condition evaluates to `true`, execute the code in the loop body, increment the
value of `age`, and then reevaluate the condition. As soon as the condition
evaluates to `false`, exit the loop.

The **iteration** is `age++`, which increments the value of `age` by `1` after
every pass through the loop. We initialized `age` as `30`, and it retains that
value during the first pass through the loop. At the end of the first pass, we
increment `age` to `31`, check whether the condition still holds `true`, and,
since it does, run the loop body again with `age` as `31`. After that second
loop, we increment `age` to `32`, and so on.

The **loop body** is the set of statements that we want to run when the
condition evaluates to `true`.

`for` loops are often used to iterate over every element in an array. As with
`age` in the birthday example above, each time the loop... _loops_..., age _increments_ by one.

Going back to our gift wrapping example, we had an array of gifts.  Each _gift_ can be accessed by calling its index: `gift[0]`, `gift[1]`, `gift[2]`, etc... With a `for` loop, we can use an _incrementing counter_, passing it inside the `[]` brackets to get back each item in an array:

```js
const gifts = ['teddy bear', 'drone', 'doll'];

function setAside(gift) {
  console.log(`Wrapped ${gift} and added a card!`);
}

for (let i = 0; i < gifts.length; i++) {
  setAside(gifts[i])
}
// LOG: Wrapped teddy bear and added a bow!
// LOG: Wrapped drone and added a bow!
// LOG: Wrapped doll and added a bow!

```

The function `setAside` is unchanged. In the `for` loop, we started our counter,
`i`, at `0` because arrays have zero-based indexes. Our condition states that we
should run the code in the loop body while `i` is less than `gifts.length` (`3`
in the above example). Our iteration, `i++`, increments our counter by `1` at
the end of each pass through the loop.

In our loop body, notice that we reference `gifts[i]`. Since `i` starts out as
`0`, during the first pass through the loop `gifts[i]` is `gifts[0]`, which is
`'teddy bear'`. During the second pass through the loop, `gifts[i]` is
`gifts[1]`, which is `'drone'`. And during the final pass through the loop,
`gifts[i]` is `gifts[2]`, which is `'doll'`. After the third pass through the
loop, we increment `i` to `3`, which is no longer less than `gifts.length`. Our
condition evaluates to `false`, and we exit the loop.

We can write `for` loops inside of functions, not just write function inside of `for` loops.  We could even rewrite the `setAside` function so that, instead of taking in _one_ gift at a time, we gift the whole array, and the function handles the loop:

```js
const gifts = ['teddy bear', 'drone', 'doll'];

function setAside(giftsArray) {
  for (let i = 0; i < giftsArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Wrapped ${giftsArray[i]} and added a card!`);
  }
}

//the entire gifts array is passed in:
setAside(gifts)

// LOG: Wrapped teddy bear and added a bow!
// LOG: Wrapped drone and added a bow!
// LOG: Wrapped doll and added a bow!
```

### Assignment

We're going to print out some welcome badges for new Klossybook employees. Build a
function named `printBadges()` that accepts one argument, an array of employee
names. Create a `for` loop with a counter that starts at `0` and increments at
the end of each loop. The condition should halt the `for` loop after the last
name in the array is printed out in the loop body.

Inside the loop, use `console.log()` to print out a badge for each employee, as
follows:

```js
printBadges(['Ada', 'Brendan', 'Ali']);
// LOG: Welcome Ada! You are employee #1.
// LOG: Welcome Brendan! You are employee #2.
// LOG: Welcome Ali! You are employee #3.
// => ["Ada", "Brendan", "Ali"]
```

After the loop completes, have the function return the original array.

## The `while` loop

The `while` loop is similar to a `for` loop in that it will keep looping as long
as the condition evaluates to `true`. However, the idea behind a `for` loop is
that it should loop a set number of times (e.g., start with `i = 0` and loop
while `i < 25`). A `while` loop, on the other hand, is designed to loop an
indefinite amount of times — it should keep looping **while** the condition is
`true` or, said differently, **until** the condition is `false`. There isn't a
definite limit like "25 times" placed upon it.

A `while` loop has the following structure:

```js
while ([condition]) {
  [loop body]
}
```

***Usage***: A `while` loop is best used when we don't know how many times a loop needs to
run. Often, this is because the condition depends on a dynamic value.

### Example

```js
function maybeTrue () {
  //Math.random returns a random value between 0 and 1
  return Math.random() >= 0.5;
}

while (maybeTrue()) {
  console.log('And I ran... I ran so far away!');
}
```

Run the above code in your browser console.   In this example, `maybeTrue()`
returns `true` half the time and `false` half the time. Our loop runs until
`maybeTrue()` returns `false`, so, theoretically, the body of the loop might
**never** run (if the first evaluation of `maybeTrue()` returns `false`) or it
might run forever (if `maybeTrue()` goes on an incredible streak with
`Math.random()` never returning anything below `0.5`). We've used a `while` loop
because we don't have any specific number to count up or down to in our loop; we
just want it to run until the condition is no longer met.

We can also use a `while` loop in place of a `for` loop. We just have to
remember to make sure the condition updates with each pass through the loop so
that the loop eventually terminates. Otherwise, it'll run forever, and we'll
have to throw our overheating computer out the window and buy a new one. Here's
an example of a `while` loop with a defined exit strategy:

```js
let countdown = 10;

while (countdown > 0) {
  console.log(--countdown);
}
```

### Assignment

We're going to create a little game for our Klossybook users to play when they're
bored. Create a function named `tailsNeverFails()` that takes no arguments. In
the function body, use a `while` loop with a condition that simulates a coin
flip (two equally likely outcomes). For inspiration, check out the `maybeTrue()`
example above. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the coin landed on 'Tails'
and is flipped again. If the condition evaluates to `false`, the coin landed on
'Heads', and the 'Tails' streak is broken. At the end of the function, `return`
a message to the user indicating how many times the coin landed on 'Tails' in a
row, e.g.:

```js
tailsNeverFails();
// => "You got 3 tails in a row!"

tailsNeverFails();
// => "You got 0 tails in a row!"

tailsNeverFails();
// => "You got 5 tails in a row!"
```

## Conclusion

If you're feeling a bit lost about when to use a `for` vs. a `while` loop, take
a deep breath. Most of the time, a regular `for` loop will suffice. It's by far
the most common looping construct in JavaScript. A general heuristic for
choosing which loop to use is to first try a `for` loop. If that doesn't serve
your purposes, then go ahead and try a `while` or [`do...while`][do...while]
loop. Also, remember that you can always refer to the [documentation on these
loops][loops and iteration] at any time. After some time programming in
JavaScript, writing a `for` loop will come as naturally to you as wrapping one
gift after another.
